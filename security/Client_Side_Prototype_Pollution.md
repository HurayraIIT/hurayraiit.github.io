# CSPP - Client Side Prototype Pollution

On Feb 02, 2023 10:00PM BDT, I was checking out the web security topics on [Portswigger Academy Learning Path](https://portswigger.net/web-security/learning-path). The topic named [Client Side Prototype Pollution](https://portswigger.net/web-security/prototype-pollution) caught my eye and I decided to learn it.

The topic contains [5 labs](https://portswigger.net/web-security/all-labs#prototype-pollution). All of which are of level practitioner. I am trying to learn JavaScript. I hope that this topic will help me to learn JavaScript Objects & Prototypes in depth and exploit CSPP vulnerabilities.

## Step 1 - Learn About JavaScript Prototypes

The best way to get a quick higher level view of a topic is to watch some YouTube videos. I did a quick search and decided to watch these videos:
